# Keywords: Chinese New Year

## Why I picked these keywords:
This Saturday is Chinese New Year. Millions of Chineses are celebrating this unqiue date in the US. However, under the bright surface, there is an issue of cultural appropriation. Cultural appropriation means the inappropriate adoption of one culture by memebers of another culture. In this case, it means people name the date like "korean new year" or " japanese new year". I am going to investigate whether this is a topic on twitter right now by searching chinese new year.

## Which locations I picked?
I picked seattle, los angeles, and new york.

## What I found?
I found that these three cities all have strong culture inclusiveness towards Chinese communities that the results are all positve. Words like "celebrate", "happy", "wish", and "rabbit" are standing out. The reason for word rabbit to stand out is because this year is year rabbit. Searching word chinese new year didnt really reveal sign of culture appropriation. In fact, after years of trying, the issue of culture appropriation on chinese new year has been reduced and more and more people realized this festival is from China. In year 2023, the only dramatic incident happened is when The British Museum tweeted "Happy korean new year" that went rage on the comments below.

## Why so positive?
The first reason and the main reason goes to the incredible inclusiveness of all three cities. You can find people came from everywhere in the world in these three cities. People do feel their culture being repected there. More and more non-chineses celebrate this date maybe because they have chinese frinds or coworkers or maybe they are just influenced by the happy vibe. The second reason is that this is the first chinese new year after the reopen from covid and people need to days like this to get out of covid and remind them the good old days before covid. 


## How can I improve in future?
I can try to search word like korean new year and see if theres anyone point out the fact of culture appropriation down in the comment. This is a really good way to find out whether people are making effort to prevent culture appropriation and whether have people realized this is culture appropriation.

## Did it differ from my expection?
Yeah I was kind shocked I thought people would argue whether it should be called chinese new year or lunar new year. I thought words like "steal", "korean", or "vitnam" would stand out.
